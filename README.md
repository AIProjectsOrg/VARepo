## 1. Dataset

1.1 Smoking CCTV Detection [[Dataset link]](https://universe.roboflow.com/smoking-gqlqh/smoking-cctv-detection-x4fjr)

- The original dataset was released by the Roboflow user SmokingCigaretteCCTV and is available at [[link]](https://universe.roboflow.com/smokingcigarettecctv/smoking-cctv-detection).
- This dataset is a **rare dataset** that focuses on **realistic CCTV scenarios**, rather than the open-angle or close-up perspectives commonly seen in most existing datasets.
- However, the **original annotations** were **incomplete**, where i) person instances were not labelled, and ii) many existing class instances were missing or incorrectly labelled.
- We **re-annotated** the dataset to better align it with the scope of our study.
- Specifically, the revised dataset contains 207 images annotated in YOLOv8 format, with **three object classes**: 1) cigarette, 2) person, and 3) smoke.

```python
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="rvc5pEYx6sd3cZ8EBcDW")
project = rf.workspace("smoking-gqlqh").project("smoking-cctv-detection-x4fjr")
version = project.version(4)
dataset = version.download("yolov8")
```

1.2 Smoking Person Detection [[Dataset link]](https://universe.roboflow.com/smoking-gqlqh/smoking-person-detection-2-ijwga)
- One issue with the aforementioned Smoking-CCTV-Detection Dataset is its limited size, containing only 207 images in total.
- This is insufficient for training a robust object detection model.
- To address this limitation, we propose using the Smoking-Person-Detection Dataset as a complementary training dataset.
- The original dataset consists of 2,789 images annotated in YOLOv8 format, with three labelled classes: 1) cigarette, 2) person, and 3) smoke.
- However, the smoke images in this dataset are significantly out-of-distribution compared to those in the Smoking-CCTV-Detection dataset.
- Specifically, these images are close-up views of smoke, which differ greatly from the surveillance or CCTV angles central to our target application.
- Also, empirical results also show that including these out-of-distribution smoke images degrades the detectorâ€™s performance. Therefore, all images containing the smoke label were removed, resulting in a filtered dataset of 2,447 images. 

```python
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="rvc5pEYx6sd3cZ8EBcDW")
project = rf.workspace("smoking-gqlqh").project("smoking-person-detection-2-ijwga")
version = project.version(1)
dataset = version.download("yolov8")
```
